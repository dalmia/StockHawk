# Stock Hawk

Stock Hawk displays the stock prices for the stocks added by the user. As a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program, I productionized the app taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state.
This involved finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization,
adding a widget, and adding a library.

##Things I learned

* Diagnosing existing issues with an app.
* Making an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allowing the app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
* Handlin error cases in Android.
* Adding a widget to your app experience.
* Leveraging the functionality of a library in your app.

## Getting Started

* Clone the project typing the following command in the git-bash/terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dalmia/StockHawk.git
    ```

* Run the project using the `/gradlew` command from the terminal in Android Studio or click on the `Import a new Project` option from the File menu.

* You can [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, issue any bugs that you may find and create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for the changes to be merged.
